# Sass development boilerplate
My boilerplate folder for web development. It have all the basics I use in most of my projects. I expect it to grow and change over time (especialy package.json and SCSS folder).

SCSS folder organization is forked from [Hugo Giraudel's sass boilerplate][sass] and modified to my liking (a lot of work still needs to be done).

## To-Do

- reconsider folder structure (general - mainly asset folder, scss folder - maybe based on ITCSS or OOCSS)
- split `_variables.scss` into several files ( `_colors.scss, _text.scss`etc.)
