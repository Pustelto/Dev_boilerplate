# Sass development boilerplate
Sass folder organization is forked from [Hugo Giraudel sass boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) and modified to my liking (a lot of work still needs to be done).

## To-Do
- Finish own CSS reset (most CSS resets are too big for me, especialy for smaller projects, as such I want to create small reset modules which I can add as necessary) Planned modules:
    - ie8/9 hakcs
    - core (most common elements - ul, p, a etc.)
    - forms (form elements)
    - other not so often elements (pre, blockquote apod.)
- add functions and mixins from my other projects (VPP project)
