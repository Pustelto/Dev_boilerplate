# Sass development boilerplate
My boilerplate folder for web development. It have all the basics I use in most of my projects. I expect it to grow and change over time (especialy package.json and SCSS folder).

SCSS folder organization is forked from [Hugo Giraudel's sass boilerplate][sass] and modified to my liking (a lot of work still needs to be done).

## To-Do
- Finish own CSS reset (most CSS resets are too big for me, especialy for smaller projects, as such I want to create small reset modules which I can add as necessary) Planned modules:
    - ie8/9 hakcs
    - core (most common elements - ul, p, a etc.)
    - forms (form elements)
    - other not so often elements (pre, blockquote apod.)
- add functions and mixins from my other projects (VPP project)
