# Atoms

The `atoms/` folder holds very basic elements from which we construct rest of the page and components. I decide to use this structure under influence of Atomic design and because I used to end up with a lot of files in `components\`folder and with very little in the others (which kinda beats the purpose of it). And some of the components were really just an atoms. Nothing really complicated.
