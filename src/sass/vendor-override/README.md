# Vendor override

It is common to use some third party plugins (slider etc.) and often you have to adjust or override CSS for these plugins. In order to leave original files unchanged (and thus make it possible for easy update) all such overrides will go to this `vendor-override\`folder.

Files should be name with the name of plugin.
